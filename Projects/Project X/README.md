# CS-202
Just a heads up for all you future CS students that are about to enter college and taking this class CS 202.
That this project is extra credit meaning you don't have to do it if you are confidence with all the previous project that you get 100%, but if one of your previous didn't get 100% you used this extra project to get 100%.
Have fun at coding in the future :)
